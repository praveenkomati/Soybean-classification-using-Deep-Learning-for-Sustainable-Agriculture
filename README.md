# Soybean Classification Using Deep Learning  
[Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify soybean leaf images into different health categories.  
It helps in early disease detection, supporting sustainable agriculture practices by reducing crop loss and pesticide usage.

## Dataset  
**Source:** PlantVillage dataset or custom soybean field images  
**Classes:** Healthy, Bacterial Blight, Downy Mildew, Rust (update based on your dataset)  
**Total Images:** ~X,XXX (update count if known)  
Dataset Link: *[Add dataset link if public]*

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Pipeline  
1. Load and preprocess dataset  
2. Apply data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom)  
3. Train CNN / Transfer Learning model (e.g., ResNet50)  
4. Evaluate model accuracy and generate confusion matrix  
5. Predict soybean health status from input image
